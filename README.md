## 🌤️ Weather Forecast Web Application

This is a React-based Weather Forecast Application that allows users to search for any city and view real-time weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast. The application fetches live data from the Open-Meteo API and presents it in a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
